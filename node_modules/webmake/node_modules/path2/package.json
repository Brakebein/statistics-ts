  "readme": "# path2\n## Modular and extended version of [Node's path](http://nodejs.org/api/path.html) package\n\nWorks exactly same as Node's `path`, with following improvements:\n\n- Both _windows_ and _posix_ versions can be accessed in any environment program is run. For windows version require `path2/windows` for posix `path2/posix`.\n- Doesn't depend on existence of `process` object and can safely be used in any enviroment (e.g. browser) which does not provide it. If `process.cwd` is not accessible, _/_ or _C:\\_ (for windows) are used as current working directory \n- Each function is provided as an individual module, so only modules that are needed, can be required e.g. `path2/resolve` or specifically posix version: `path2/posix/resolve`\n\nOne additional function, not present in native `path`, is provided:\n\n### path.common(path1[, ...pathn])\n\nResolves common path for given path arguments:\n```javascript\npath.common('/lorem/ipsum/foo/bar', '/lorem/ipsum/raz/dwa',\n  '/lorem/elo/foo/bar'); //  => '/lorem'\n```\n\n`path.common` is proposed to be [included in native `path`](https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/6328)\n\n### Installation\n#### NPM\n\nIn your project path:\n\n\t$ npm install path2\n\n##### Browser\n\nYou can easily bundle _path2_ for browser with [modules-webmake](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake)\n\n## Tests [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/medikoo/path2.png)](https://travis-ci.org/medikoo/path2)\n\n\t$ npm test\n",
